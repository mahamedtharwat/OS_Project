# 1. FCFS algorithm ðŸ’¡:
  * the process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first.
## Advantage: 
  * The simplest CPU-scheduling algorithm.
## Disadvantage:  
  * The average waiting time under the FCFS policy is often quite long.

# 2. The round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm ðŸ’¡:
  * is similar to FCFS scheduling, but preemption is added to enable the system to switch between processes.
  *  The RR scheduling algorithm is thus preemptive.

# 3. SJF Non Premp ðŸ’¡:
  * A non-preemptive SJF algorithm will allow the currently running process to finish its CPU burst
